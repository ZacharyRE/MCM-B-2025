## Justification and Assumption:

**Assumption 1: The daily number of tourists remains constant during peak seasons.**

**Justification 1**: This assumption is supported by the scheduling of cruise ships and pre-booked accommodations in Juneau, which cap daily tourist numbers. Historical data show consistent visitor peaks during the summer months.

**Assumption 2: Spending per head is uniform for a particular category of tourist.**

**Justification 2**: Cruise tourists and independent travelers tend to follow predictable spending habits because of set costs for tours, accommodations, and dining options.


**Assumption 3:Tourist tax revenue is proportional to the number of visitors.**

**Justification 3:** Tourist tax is charged on a per capita basis and directly scales with the number of tourists. This is confirmed by existing taxation policies in Juneau.


**Assumption 4:Tourist tax revenue is proportional to the number of visitors.**

**Justification 4:** The environmental impact of activities like glacier tours and whale watching can be reliably predicted using historical data, showing little variation between similar activities.



**Assumption 5:Carbon emissions per tourist are proportional to travel distance.**

**Justification 5:** Transportation emissions (e.g., cruise ships, flights) scale **linearly** with distance traveled, as reported in tourism carbon footprint studies.


**Assumption 6: Environmental degradation is proportional to tourist numbers.**

**Justification 6:** Higher visitor numbers increase waste generation, resource consumption, and habitat disturbance, all these lead to proportional environmental impacts.



**Assumption 7: Congestion costs increase nonlinearly as tourist numbers approach carrying capacity..**

**Justification 7:** Social costs related to congestion, like delays and overcrowding, increase rapidly as tourist numbers push the limits of existing infrastructure.



**Assumption 8:Infrastructure costs scale linearly with tourist numbe**

**Justification 8:** Spending on waste management, transportation, and utilities tends to rise steadily as visitor numbers go up, according to past infrastructure maintenance reports.


**Assumption 9:The distribution of tourists between cruise visitors and independent travelers is fixed during the season**

**Justification 9:** Cruise schedules and independent travel patterns are well-documented and show minimal variation during the peak season. Which means these two kinds of visitors are independent.



**Assumption 10:No significant external shocks occur during the analysis period**

**Justification 10:** External factors, such as natural disasters or economic crises, are assumed absent to focus on baseline conditions and easier for our analysis.
